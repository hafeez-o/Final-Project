	<p>Football is the name of the most popular sport on earth and also a name that a lot of sports share related or not. The most world known and most recognised form of football is soccer also known as soccer. This sport originated from the eighteenth century and was organised by the English and the sport was formed. The English which were the dominant force in the world then who had colonised at least fifty countries in the world. The british were very crucial to the spread of ths game because anywhere they colonised they often shared the game with the inhab itants of that land. Some explorers and tourists and adventurers will meet the british who know the sport and learn and then go and teach the natives of their towns or cities. This spread the game and when every body could play the game it became more of an official thing and thus the introduction of teams and referees and rules and so on. the game was really looking up. The first ever football amtch wa sheld between england and scotland which england won. By 1928 football was oficially feature in the Olympics and Uruguay took Gold. After that an association was formed and it was called FIFA (Federal International Football Association) and 1930 was to be the year for the first world cup and it was to be hosted by uruguay mostly because they won the olympic gold.</p>

	<p>The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men's national association football teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 July to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament.
	<p>Thirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America) entered the tournament. Few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4–1 and Belgium 3–0, respectively. Lucien Laurent of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while American goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the first official "clean sheet" in the tournament.</p>

	<p> Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States are the teams in the americas that participated in this world cup. This was a world cup that didnt feature qualification and so any country that met the requirenents and showed interest was allowed to participate.Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia are the european teams that paricpated.
