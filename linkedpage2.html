	<h3>Bulgaria</h3>
	<img src="images/bulgaria-2014.jpg">
	<p>Bulgaria is a side that has produced incredible individual talent over the years but have failed to meet expectations on many occasions. They have failed to qualify for any world cup in the 21st century till date.</p>
	<p>They have managed qualification 7 times out of 20 and have placed fourth after losing in the semi-final.</p>

	<h3>Ireland</h3>
	<img src="images/ireland-2014.jpg">
	<p>Ireland have managed to qualify for three world cups and have a 100% record of always going past the first round and their best finish coming in 1990 which was hosted by Italy, they reached the Quarter-finals an incredible feat and actually lost to Italy and actually had revenge in the following world cup where they beat Italy in their opening game.</p>

	<h3>Poland</h3>
	<img src="images/poland-2014.jpg">
	<p>Poland is a team that have qualified for 7 out of 20 world cup and have worked very hard over the years and have the records to show for it, coming third twice in 1974 and 1982. They were a very consistent squad back in the day although they have failed to qualify for the last two world cups and have failed to pass the group stage the last two times they did qualify.</p>

	<h3>Croatia</h3>
	<img src="images/croatia-2014.jpg">
	<p>With a very young national team they have qualified for 4 out of 6 world cups since their establishment. And reached the semi-finals of their very first world cup and they came third which was very impressive at their first world cup. They had a very capable team that conceeded only 4 goals in seven games.</p>

	<h3>England</h3>
	<img src="images/england-2014.jpg">
	<p>Although they were the team that practically invented the sport England failed to enter the first three world cups. They have qualified for 14 out of 20 world cups which is impressive.</p>
	<p>England have won the world cup once and it was the time they hosted it back in 1966 and they have come fourth in 1990 hosted by Italy. They have the best club football league in the world.</p>

	<h3>France</h3>
	<img src="images/france-2014.jpg">
	<p>France is a very strong and decorated side in football, past and present and have hosted two world cups so far and have managed to win one of the world cups that they hosted in 1998, beating a broken Brazil side in the final. They have produced a lot of talented players over the years and hosted the recent Euro 2016 which they came second in losing in the finals to Portugal. They are one of the countries that have participated in the most world cup since it started.</p>

	<img class="logo"src="images/holland-2015.jpg"></a>
	<h3>Holland</h3>
	<img src="images/holland-2014.jpg">
	<p>The dutch have qualified for ten world cups and have an incredible feat of getting to the finals five times only Brazil and Italy can compare to that,  one difference between holland and those two is that they haven't won a single world-cup, five times entering the finals half the times entering the finals and getting silver every single time. It's a feat some people will never get over and is something they might not be able to change as their quality continues to decrease as they failed to qualify for the Euros 2016.</p>
